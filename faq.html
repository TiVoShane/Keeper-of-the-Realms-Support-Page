                <p>I mean, if you've made it this far, you likely already know.  However, just in case..... Keeper of the Realms is a Dungeon Master companion app designed to help track/create campaigns and player characters while also letting you play those campaigns with friends by turning over the Dungeon Master resposibilites to the app. We utilize Gemini, a Large Language Model, to provide the DM for you.  
                    <br>The DM requires highly detailed information about the campaign in order to ensure the campaigns plays out as expected. The DM will fill gaps when needed if the adventure goes an unexpected direction."</p>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">9. What if Siri doesn't recognize my custom phrase?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Ensure your phrase is clear and unique. If you need to, rename the shortcut so it's more natural to you and easier to understand for Siri. Adding "with Penny" at the end of the name can help Siri understand that it's a shortcut associated with Penny. So consider changing the phrase to something like "Create a Festival Foods expense with Penny"strong> and see if that works better.
